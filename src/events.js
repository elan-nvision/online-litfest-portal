  The language which bonds the universe. <br />
  
  The language in which almost all the literature in the world is written. <br />
  
  Let's celebrate this love with Sweetheart, our love-themed writing competition. Let your heart out on paper and turn in absolutely ANYTHING related to love. From how they stole your heart on the first day of class, or how someone else swooped in and stole them from you. Love letters, poems, stories or even fangirling: we'll take it all. <br />
  
  So for all those who are too shy to show their cute and cringeworthy writings to their friends, this is the perfect opportunity to bring out the Raj Malhotra in you.
